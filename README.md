## Fixed Point Training Simulation Framework on PyTorch

### Core Functionality
- Parameter/Buffer fix: by using `nics_fix_pt.nn_fix.<original name>_fix` modules;
  parameters are those to be trained, buffers are those to be persistenced but not considered parameter
- Activation fix: by using `ActivationFix` module
- Data fix VS. Gradient fix: by supply `nf_fix_params`/`nf_fix_params_grad` kwargs args
      in `nics_fix_pt.nn_fix.<original name>_fix` or `ActivationFix` module construction

> NOTE: When constructing a fixed-point module, the dictionary you passed in as `nf_fix_params` argument will be used directly, so if you pass the same configuration dict to two modules. These two module will share the same configurations... If you want each module to be quantized independently, you should construct different configuration dict for each module.

The underhood quantization of each datum is implemented in `nics_fix.quant._do_quantitize`, the code is easy to understand, if you need different plug-in quantize method other than this default one, or maybe need a configurable behavior of `_do_quantitize`(maybe in simulation for simultaneous computation on different types of device), please contribute for a pluggable and configurable `_do_quantitize` (I believe this will be a simple change), or you can contact me.

### Examples
See `examples/mnist/train_mnist.py` for a MNIST fix-point training example, and some demo usage of the utilities.

### Usage Explained

**How to make a module fixed-point**

If you have implemented your new module type, e.g. a masked convolution module type (a convolution with a mask that is generated by prunning) `MaskedConv2d`, you want a fixed-point version of it, just do:
```python
from nics_fix_pt import register_fix_module
register_fix_module(MaskedConv2d)
```

Then you can construct the fixed-point module, and use it in the following code. All of it functionalities will stay the same, except the weights and the gradient of weights(optionally) will be converted to fixed-point before each usage.

```python
import nics_fix_pt.nn_fix as nnf
masked_conv = nnf.MaksedConv2d_fix(...your paramters, including fixed-point configs...)
```

The internal registered fixed-point modules are already tested in our test examples and our other works:

* `torch.nn.Linear`
* `torch.nn.Conv2d`
* `torch.nn.BatchNorm1d`
* `torch.nn.BatchNorm2d`

> NOTE: We expect most `torch.nn` modules will work well without special handling, so you can use the AutoRegister functionality, which will auto register non-registered `torch.nn` modules. However, as we do not test all these modules thoroughly, if you find some modules fail to work normally in some use case, please tell us or contribute to handle that specially.

**How to inspect the float-point precision/quantized datum**

Network parameters are saved as float in `module._parameters[<parameter or buffer name>]`, and `module.<parameter or buffer name>` is the fixed-point/quantized version. You can either use `module._parameters`, or `<quantized tensor>.nfp_actual_data` (e.g. `masked_conv.weights.nfp_actual_data`) to access the float-point precision datum.

As `module._parameters` and `module._buffers` are used by `model.state_dict`, when you dump checkpoints onto the disk, the saved network parameters using `model.state_dict` is float precision:
* In your use cases(e.g. fixed-point hardware simultation), together with the saved float-point precision parameters, you might need to dump and then load/modify the fixed configurations of the variables using `model.get_fix_configs` and `model.load_fix_configs`. Check `examples/mnist/train_mnist.py` for an example.
* Or if you want to directly dump the latest used version of the parameters (which might be a quantitized tensor, depend on your latest configuration), use `nnf.FixTopModule.fix_state_dict(module)` for dumping instead.

**How to config the fixed-point behavior**

Every fixed-point module need a fixed-point configuration, and an optional fixed-point configuration for the gradients.

A config for the module should be a dict, keys are the parameter or buffer names, values is a dict includes torch tensors (for current "bitwidth", "method", "scale"), which are modified in place by function calls to `nics_fix_pt.quant.quantitize_cfg`;

**How to check/manage the configuration**

1. For each quantitized datum, you can use `<quantized tensor>.data_cfg` or `<quantized tensor>.grad_cfg`, e.g. `masked_conv.weights.data_cfg` or `masked_conv.bias.data_cfg`.
2. You can also use `FixTopModule.get_fix_configs(module)` to get configs for multiple modulues in one OrderedDict.

You can modify the config tensors in place to change the behavior.

### Utilities

- FixTopModule: dump/load fix configuration to/from file; print fix configs.

  FixTopModule is just a wrapper that gather config print/load/dump/setting utilities, these utilities will work with nested normal nn.Module as intermediate module containers, e.g. `nn.Sequential` of fixed modules will also work, you do not need to have a subclass multi-inherited from `nn.Sequential` and `nnf.FixTopModule`!

- AutoRegister: auto register corresponding fixed-point modules for modules in `torch.nn`: Automatically register all not-registered module by proxing to modules in torch.nn. Exampe usage:
  ```python
  from nics_fix_pt import NAR as nnf_auto
  bilinear = nnf_auto.Bilinear_fix(...parameters...)
  ```

### Test cases
